Canonical SEO OS Workflow

(CL-SEO-OS v1.0)

This document defines the authoritative, repeatable workflow for executing SEO OS builds from input → launch.

This workflow is deterministic.
Deviations increase risk and reduce repeatability.

Core Principle

Rules → Coverage → Authority → Conversion → Trust → Local Dominance → Behavioral Polish → Codify

SEO OS does not optimize everything at once.
Each phase has a single purpose, hard constraints, and a clear stop condition.

# CL-SEO-OS

**CL-SEO-OS** (Customer-Led Search Engine Optimization Operating System)  
A deterministic, scalable framework for generating SEO, AEO, and full website builds — optimized for modern search and AI-first retrieval.

This project acts as:
- a **prompt library**
- a **strategy engine**
- a **site build specification**
- a **pSEO generator**

It’s designed to be used in conjunction with AI website builders such as **Antigravity**, **Zo**, **Bolt**, **Devin AI**, or **Gemini Studio**.

## 🧠 What This Is

**CL-SEO-OS** is not a one-off strategy doc — it’s an *operating system for search growth*.

At its core it provides:
- A repeatable SEO + AEO workflow
- Programmatic SEO (pSEO) patterns
- Clear execution playbooks
- Full website architecture + component specs
- Output formats that can be dropped into AI builders

Think of it as a **compiler** that turns business inputs into:
- search architecture
- scaling page blueprints
- optimization rules
- indexing playbooks

## 🧩 How to Use

2. Provide business inputs (domain, name, description, location, audience, conversion goal)
3. Run the **SEO OS++ prompt** (located in `/core/seo-os++.md`)
4. Feed the outputs to your AI builder or developer
5. Review and deploy

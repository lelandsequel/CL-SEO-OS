# SEO OS — START HERE

SEO OS is a modular system that EXTENDS an existing website.
It does NOT replace your site and does NOT redesign anything.

If you are integrating SEO OS into an existing site:
1. Read INTEGRATION.md
2. Use an adapter from /adapters
3. Do NOT rebuild core pages
4. Only add programmatic pages, schema, and sitemap logic

If you are an agent (Zo / Antigravity):
- Follow INTEGRATION.md exactly
- Use /adapters/nextjs-app-router as the reference
- Refactor existing work instead of regenerating

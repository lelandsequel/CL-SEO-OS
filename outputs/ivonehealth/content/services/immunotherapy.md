## What is Immunotherapy?

Immunotherapy harnesses and enhances the body's own immune system to fight disease. Unlike traditional treatments, immunotherapy helps the immune system recognize and attack specific targets such as cancer cells.

## How Immunotherapy Works

Immunotherapy treatments work by:

- Activating the immune system to better recognize disease
- Removing barriers that prevent immune cells from attacking targets
- Providing the immune system with additional components to fight disease
- Training the body to remember and respond to specific threats

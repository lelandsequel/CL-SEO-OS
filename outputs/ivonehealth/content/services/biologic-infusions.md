## What are Biologic Infusions?

Biologic infusion therapy delivers advanced medications that target specific components of the immune system. Unlike traditional medications that affect the entire immune system, biologics precisely target the pathways causing inflammation.

## How Biologic Therapy Works

Biologic medications are derived from living cells and designed to:

- Block specific inflammatory proteins (like TNF-alpha or interleukins)
- Interrupt the inflammatory cascade at key points
- Achieve deeper remission in chronic conditions
- Prevent disease progression and tissue damage

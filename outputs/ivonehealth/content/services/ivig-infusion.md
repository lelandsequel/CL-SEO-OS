## What is IVIG Infusion Therapy?

Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy delivers concentrated antibodies directly into the bloodstream. This treatment helps patients with immune deficiencies or autoimmune conditions by supplementing or modulating their immune response.

## How IVIG Therapy Works

IVIG contains immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies pooled from thousands of donors. When infused, these antibodies can:

- Replace missing antibodies in immune-deficient patients
- Modulate an overactive immune system in autoimmune conditions
- Provide passive immunity against infections

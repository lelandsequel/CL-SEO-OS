# What Infusion Options Exist for Rheumatoid Arthritis?

Multiple infusion options exist for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) like anti-TNF agents, B-cell inhibitors, T-cell costimulation blockers, and IL-6 inhibitors. IVIG may also be used in selected cases.

## Types of RA Infusion Therapies

### Anti-TNF Biologics
Block TNF-alpha, a major inflammatory protein in RA. Infliximab is a commonly infused anti-TNF agent.

### B-cell Depleting Agents
Target CD20-positive B cells that contribute to joint inflammation and damage.

### T-cell Costimulation Blockers
Interrupt the activation of T cells that drive RA inflammation.

### IL-6 Inhibitors
Block interleukin-6, reducing inflammation and systemic symptoms.

### IVIG
May be used for RA-related complications or when other treatments aren't suitable.

## Infusion vs. Injectable Biologics

| Factor | Infusion | Injectable |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Frequency** | Every 4-8 weeks | Weekly to monthly |
| **Administration** | Clinical setting | Home or clinic |
| **Monitoring** | During infusion | Self-administered |
| **Drug types** | Some biologics only available as infusion | Many overlap |

## Choosing an Infusion Therapy

Your rheumatologist will consider disease severity, previous treatments, other health conditions, and your preferences when recommending an infusion therapy.

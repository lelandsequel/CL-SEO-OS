# How Long Does a Biologic Infusion Take?

A biologic infusion typically takes 1-4 hours depending on the specific medication, dosage, and whether it is a loading dose or maintenance dose. Some biologic infusions can be completed in as little as 30 minutes, while others may require longer administration times.

## Factors Affecting Infusion Duration

Several factors influence how long a biologic infusion takes:

| Factor | Impact on Duration |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Medication type** | Different biologics have different protocols |
| **Loading vs. maintenance** | Initial doses often take longer |
| **Patient tolerance** | Some patients require slower rates |
| **Reaction history** | Previous reactions may require slower infusion |

## Common Biologic Infusion Times

- **Anti-TNF agents (e.g., infliximab)**: 2-3 hours initially, may be shortened over time
- **B-cell depleting agents**: 4-6 hours for first infusion
- **Integrin inhibitors**: 30 minutes to 1 hour

## What to Expect

Plan to spend additional time beyond the infusion itself for:

- Pre-infusion assessment and vital signs
- Medication preparation
- Post-infusion monitoring (typically 15-30 minutes)

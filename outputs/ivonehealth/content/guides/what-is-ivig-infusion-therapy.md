# What is IVIG Infusion Therapy?

IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) infusion therapy is a medical treatment that delivers concentrated antibodies directly into the bloodstream through an IV. These antibodies are collected from the plasma of thousands of donors and help patients with immune deficiencies or autoimmune conditions.

## How IVIG Therapy Works

IVIG provides passive immunity by delivering immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. For patients with immune deficiencies, it replaces missing antibodies. For patients with autoimmune conditions, it helps modulate an overactive immune response.

## Who May Benefit from IVIG

IVIG therapy may be prescribed for patients with:

- Primary immune deficiency disorders
- Certain autoimmune conditions
- Neurological conditions like chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
- Select inflammatory conditions

## What to Expect During Treatment

IVIG infusions typically take 2-6 hours and are administered in a clinical setting. Patients receive ongoing monitoring during treatment. Most patients receive infusions monthly, though frequency varies based on condition and response.

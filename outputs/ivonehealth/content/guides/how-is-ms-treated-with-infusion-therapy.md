# How is Multiple Sclerosis Treated with Infusion Therapy?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be treated with infusion therapy using disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that reduce inflammation and slow disease progression. Infused medications include IVIG and various biologic agents that modulate the immune system's attack on nerve tissue.

## Types of Infusion Therapy for MS

### IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin)
IVIG delivers antibodies that help regulate the immune system. While not a first-line treatment for all MS types, it may be used in certain situations under physician guidance.

### Monoclonal Antibody Infusions
Several FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies are administered via infusion:
- B-cell depleting agents that reduce inflammatory cells
- Integrin blockers that prevent immune cells from entering the brain
- CD20-targeted therapies

## Benefits of Infusion vs. Oral Treatments

- More consistent drug levels
- Less frequent dosing (monthly to twice yearly)
- May be more effective for aggressive disease
- Directly monitored administration

## What to Expect

MS infusion treatments are administered in clinical settings with trained staff. Treatment duration varies from 1-6 hours depending on the medication. Patients are monitored during and after infusion.

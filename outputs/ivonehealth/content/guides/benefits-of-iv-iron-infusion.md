# What Are the Benefits of IV Iron Infusion?

IV iron infusion offers rapid and effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia by delivering iron directly into the bloodstream. The main benefits include faster iron replenishment, better tolerance than oral supplements, and higher absorption rates for patients with GI conditions.

## Key Benefits of IV Iron

### Faster Results
IV iron bypasses the digestive system and delivers iron directly to the bloodstream. Patients often notice symptom improvement within days to weeks, compared to months with oral supplements.

### Better Tolerance
Unlike oral iron supplements, IV iron does not cause common GI side effects like nausea, constipation, or stomach upset.

### Higher Absorption
Patients with conditions affecting iron absorption (like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease) often benefit more from IV iron than oral supplements.

### Single or Few Doses
Many IV iron formulations can replenish iron stores in one or a few sessions, improving adherence compared to daily oral supplements.

## Who May Benefit from IV Iron

- Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron
- Patients with absorption issues
- Patients needing rapid iron correction (before surgery, during pregnancy)
- Cancer patients with treatment-related anemia

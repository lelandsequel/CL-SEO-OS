# How Does Immunotherapy Work?

Immunotherapy works by activating, enhancing, or directing the body's immune system to recognize and fight disease, particularly cancer. Unlike chemotherapy which directly kills cells, immunotherapy empowers the immune system to do the work itself.

## Types of Immunotherapy

### Checkpoint Inhibitors
These drugs release the "brakes" on the immune system. Cancer cells often activate immune checkpoints to avoid detection. Checkpoint inhibitors block these signals, allowing immune cells to attack cancer.

### Monoclonal Antibodies
Lab-made proteins designed to target specific parts of cancer cells. Some mark cancer cells for destruction; others block signals that help cancer grow.

### CAR-T Cell Therapy
A patient's own immune cells are modified to better recognize cancer and then infused back into the body.

## How Immunotherapy Differs from Chemotherapy

| Aspect | Immunotherapy | Chemotherapy |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Mechanism** | Activates immune system | Directly kills cells |
| **Targeting** | More specific | Less specific |
| **Side effects** | Immune-related | Cell toxicity |
| **Memory effect** | May provide lasting immune memory | No lasting effect |

## What to Expect

Immunotherapy is administered via infusion over 30 minutes to several hours. Treatment schedules vary from weekly to monthly depending on the protocol.
